# Install Home-Assistant

[Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) installation can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/).

It's very straight-forward and depends where you want to install.

Normally people install on Raspbery Pi Boxes.

I installed on Mac which is straight forward. Just follow [Instructions to install](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/macos/) 

Another prefer way is [Docker image](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/).

Cherry on the cake - Install [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) on Raspbery Pi and use docker image to install in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Pre-Requisites:
1. Python 3.5.3 or later
2. PIP

```
$ pip3 install homeassistant
```
