# Configure Nginx

**This part is optional.**

I am using nginx as reverse-proxy to hit all my traffic on it and then forward it to [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Configuration is straight forward. I used the attached file for my nginx configuration.

Don't forget to change your IP-Address.

# Configure Apache

Also attach is the apache configuration.

Just put this for [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) virtual-host file.
